        popular among treasure hunters looking for buried artifacts and coins.\n\nIn addition \
        to his work on metal detectors, Fischer also invented a number of other \
        devices, including a waterproof flashlight and a portable radio receiver. \
        He founded the Fischer Research Laboratory in 1936, which became one of the \
        leading manufacturers of metal detectors in the world.\n\nFischer received \
        numerous awards and honors for his inventions, including the Thomas A. \
